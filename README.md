# The Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) model

The LCOH Ninja is a Python project to simulate the hydrogen output and cost from green hydrogen plants powered by wind and solar, globally. The wind and solar power profiles are taken from [Renewables.ninja](https://www.renewables.ninja/) (wind) and developed using the [PV Lib module](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (solar)


## Requirements

[Python](https://www.python.org/) version 3+


Required libraries:
 * numpy
 * xarray
 * matplotlib
 * cartopy
 * pandas
 * scipy
 * joblib
 * datetime
 * os
 * regionmask

## SETUP

### Generate and download renewable power profiles
First, download the necessary input data from NASA's [MERRA-2 reanalysis](https:///gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/), including windspeed at 10m and solar irradiance. Using [PV Lib](https://pvlib-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and the [Virtual Wind Farm Model](https://github.com/renewables-ninja/vwf/tree/master), generate renewable profiles for the year and geographies of interest. Renewable profiles can also be developed using the renewable_calculator.py script.

Save the files into the running folder under /MERRA2_INPUTS/SOLAR_CF and /MERRA2_INPUTS/WIND_CF and with the necessary filenames.

### Set up the LCOH model
With the required libraries installed, the model should just require editing of the paths in the hydrogen_model.py script and setting the conditions for the model run in lines 862 - 870 (difference in solar fraction, electrolyser technology, electrolyser size optimisation, electrolyser capex and the number of cores).

### Process renewables data into hydrogen production and economics
Performing the LCOH model run is very computationally expensive and requires substantial working memory on your computer. To run the model, run the hydrogen_model.py script with the desired regions and input files. This process should yield a set of NetCDF files in the output folder that has been specified, which contain details of the cost, investment requirements and hydrogen output at each MERRA-2 gridcell.

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

First, edit the paths in the hydrogen_model script and ensure that the input folders (DATA, MERRA2_INPUTS/WIND_CF/ and MERRA2_INPUTS/SOLAR_CF) are set up correctly.
Second, ensure that all the required data files are in the DATA folder. Several files need to be downloaded and directly added, including: 
*[ETOPO_bathymetry.nc](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model) 
*[distance2shore.nc](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/distance-to-nearest-coastline-0-04-degree-grid). 
Download both and add to /DATA/
Third, decide on the model parameters that you wish to use, including: 
 * fract_diff (difference in solar fraction being computed e.g., 0.25 to give results for 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%...)
 * elec_tech (PEM or Alkaline), optimisation (whether to optimise the electrolyser size)
 * elec_capex (cost of the electrolyser in USD/kW)
 * num_cores (number of computing cores to use for the parallelisation) and latitude and longitude limits for the calculation

Fourth, run the hydrogen_model.py. I recommend that you save a different version for each model configuration run. Given the large volumes of data and the optimisation of electrolyser size on a location by location basis, it is very slow to run (e.g., 3 weeks for a year of data globally).

## POSTPROCESSING

Graph plotting functions and other postprocessing scripts (e.g., cost-supply curve generation, LCOH heatmaps) are included in the postprocessing folder.
